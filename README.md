# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 

This project is a [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://justinwookim.github.io/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer/) that visualizes the sorting process of three popular sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. It provides an interactive interface to showcase and observe how these algorithms work. 

## Introduction 

Understanding how sorting algorithms function and perform is essential for any computer scientist or software developer. This visualizer aims to provide a simple, interactive way to observe the sorting process step-by-step. 

## Supported Sorting Algorithms 
### Merge Sort

### Quick Sort 

### Bubble Sort
